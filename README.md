# Low-Carb Doctor Tracker
This repository tracks the low carb/carnivore/keto doctors/professors/researchers with legitimate credentials. Not saying an MD is required to give nutritional advice, as [medical schools don't really teach nutrition](https://time.com/6282404/nutrition-education-doctors/), but I'd like to see doctors reflecting on some of the controversial topics from their standpoint.

Steps to contribute:
1. Create an issue to either add or edit a row. Issue format: Action, Name. Examples:
  - Add, Eric Westman
  - Edit, Eric Westman
3. Claim that issue in the issue's comments section.
4. Make the edit, create a pull request, wait for it to merge, any submission without legitimate source will be rejected.

This way we make sure we don't step on each other's foot, and we have a collective list of low-carb doctors.
