# Low-Carb Doctor Tracker
This repository tracks the low carb/carnivore/keto doctors with legitimate credentials.
Steps to contribute:
1. Create an issue to either add or edit a row. Issue format: Action, Name
..* Add, Eric Westman
..* Edit, Eric Westman
3. Claim that issue in the issue's comments section.

This way we make sure we don't step on each other's foot, and we have a collective list of low-carb doctors.
