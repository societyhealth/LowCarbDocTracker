# Low-Carb Doctor Tracker
This repository tracks the low carb/carnivore/keto doctors/professors/researchers with legitimate credentials. Not saying an MD is required to give nutritional advice, as [medical schools don't really teach nutrition](https://time.com/6282404/nutrition-education-doctors/), but I'd like to see doctors reflecting on some of the controversial topics from their standpoint.

Steps to contribute:
1. Create an issue to either add or edit a row. Issue format: Action, Name. Examples:
  - Add, Eric Westman
  - Edit, Eric Westman
3. Claim that issue in the issue's comments section.
4. Make the edit, create a pull request, wait for it to merge, any submission without legitimate source will be rejected. A good thing about open-source is you get to see why, and even rejected, the record will be there forever.

This way we make sure we don't step on each other's foot, and we have a collective list of low-carb doctors.
